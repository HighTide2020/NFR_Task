# File Mover

This C# program monitors a source directory for new files and moves them to a destination directory. If the moved file is a text file, it logs the first line in a log file. It also handles errors and ensures that required directories exist. Make sure to replace `sourceDirectory`, `destinationDirectory`, and `logFile` with your desired paths.
